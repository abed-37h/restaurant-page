# Restaurant Page

## Overview

This project is part of the JavaScript course maintained by The Odin Project. It focuses on practicing code organization using concepts and tools we've learned, with a primary emphasis on Webpack. I've created a restaurant page as required, which you can see [here](https://abed-37h.github.io/restaurant-page/).

## Features

- [x] Explore the menu with its different categories
- [x] Reach the restaurant through provided contact details, or by sending a message. (Virtually)
- [ ] Add a carousel in home page that shows some random or top items on the menu.
- [ ] Let the user choose multiple menu categories to be shown in masonry grid view (filter by category).
- [ ] Add admin control panel, so that they can add new menu items. This requires using some sort of database.

## Acquired skills

- Practice using ES6 modules.
- Gained proficiency in using Webpack for module bundling, asset management, and code optimization to enhance web application performance and maintainability.
- Make the first use JavaScript Custom Events learned in previous lesson about DOM Manipulation.
- Learn how to deploy subfolder, typically `dist`, on `main` branch to `gh-pages` branch.
- Learn how to use JSON format. As well as, how to import images dynamically, which their URL might be saved in a JSON file.
